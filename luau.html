    <p>If you want to attend their luau dinner, be sure to reserve your space early!
        <br>The Polynesian Cultural Center has one of the best luaus on the island. Just keep in mind that this is located pretty far from our wedding venue, and it would be much more worth your time to spend the entire day here.
        <br> Come learn about history and culture throughout the Pacific at this world-class interactive cultural museum. Attend live cultural presentations, sample food, make traditional crafts, and much more. If you want to fully experience all of the villages, plan to be here for more than one day. It is about an hour drive from our wedding venue (assuming no traffic), so plan accordingly. There are also available shuttles from Waikiki. You will spend a lot of time outdoors, so wear sunscreen and consider bringing a hat/sunglasses. If you only have one day to spend here, we recommend starting with the villages of Hawaii and Samoa.</p>
                        
    <a href="https://www.paradisecove.com/luau-packages"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Paradise Cove</a>
    
    <p>This is one of the popular luaus on Oahu. Note that it is far from our wedding venue, so plan accordingly.</p>
                        
    <a href="https://www.germainesluau.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Germaine's Luau</a>
    
    <p>Another popular luau on Oahu. Why are they all so far away from Waikiki? We may never know.</p>

        <p> Did you just want Hawaiian food and not actually want to pay almost $200 for dinner and a show? Check out our local food page, especially Waiahole Poi Factory.</p>

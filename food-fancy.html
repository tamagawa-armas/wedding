    <h2>Our recommendations for:
    <br>
     Fancy Meals</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text version.</p>
    
    <p>Note: nothing here is Michelin-star fancy, but consider showing up in something better than a t-shirt and slippers (flip-flops), and be prepared to pay a little more.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.haleiwajoes.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Haleiwa Joe's</a>
    <p>If you're looking to enjoy locally-inspired flavors (or a GIANT slab of prime rib) while overlooking the beautiful Koolau mountain range, the Kaneohe location is the place for you! They don't take reservations and have a small parking lot, so if you don't want to wait forever for a table you're best bet is to show up before they open.</p>
    
    <p>We have never been to the Haleiwa location, but presumably it's very good, too.</p>
    
    <a href="https://53bythesea.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">53 by the Sea</a>
    
    <p>Good food and stunning views of Diamond Head from their panoramic windows. </p>
    
    <a href="https://yoheisushi.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Yohei Sushi</a>
    
    <p>This (the Dilingham location) is Sheri's family's favorite Japanese restaurant. Sheri's favorite dish is the Yohei special Sushi Zen (it comes with a tiny scoop of ice cream at the end!). The Kahala location is significantly more expensive, so we haven't gone there.</p>

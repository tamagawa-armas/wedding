    <h2>Our recommendations for:
    <br>
     Beaches</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    <p>Some notes about beaches in Hawaii:
    <ul>
    <li>Monk seals and honu (green sea turtles) are highly endangered, but also super cute!  If you see one, stay at least 50 feet back, and keep quiet. Use the zoom on your camera to take pictures and cherish the moment if you see one!</li>
    <li>Removing sand from the beach is illegal.</li>
    <li>We expect an influx of jellyfish about 9-12 days after each full moon. This means June 19-22 before our wedding, so be cautious if entering the water during this time.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <header>Waikiki Beach</header>
    
    <p>No tourism visit to Oahu is complete without visiting this iconic beach. Located just behind our wedding venue, there's no excuse not to go for a stroll. Enjoy the world-famous coral sand, views of Diamond Head, and surfable waves. You can also find the statue of Duke Kahanamoku, snorkel, or take a surfing lesson. </p>
    
    <header>Kailua Beach</header>
    
    <p>If you're looking for a beautiful coral sand beach with (slightly) less crowds than Waikiki, drive over to the Windward side to check out Kailua Beach.</p>
    
    <header>Kualoa Regional Park</header>
    
    <p>For those looking for a beach that hasn't been overrun by tourists (yet), head farther north to Kualoa. There's less sand than the previously mentioned beaches, but Sheri has many memories from her childhood walking along this beach and picking up cat's eye seashells during low tide. You can also check out the bird sanctuary and see if you can spot any endemic species, like the <a href="https://hawaiibirdingtrails.hawaii.gov/bird/hawaiian-black-necked-stilt/"; target="_blank">Hawaiian stilt</a>. Be careful of <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/portuguese-man-o-war.html", target="_blank">Portuguese man-of-war</a> in this area.</p>

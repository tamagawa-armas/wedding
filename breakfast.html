    <a href="https://www.lilihabakery.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Liliha Bakery</a> 
    
    <p>This is Andrew and Sheri's favorite breakfast spot when they visit Oahu. Everything on the menu is good, and the portions are large so bring a big appetite! If you're still hungry after breakfast, check out their bakery counter. They are famous for the their coco puffs, topped with their chantilly frosting. Their chantilly cakes are Sheri's favorite cake of all time.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.zippys.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Zippy's Restaurant</a>
    
    <p>While we usually stop here for dinner, their breakfast is also very good. Everything on the breakfast menu is ono. If you're looking for a local dish, try their loco moco or a side of papaya. </p>

    <p>Try the breakfast platters with spam or Portuguese sausage - only available in Hawaii! Spam, eggs, and rice is a common breakfast combination that Sheri and Andrew eat regularly.</p>

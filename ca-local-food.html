     Japanese/Hawaii Food</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    <a href="https://tokyocentral.com/waka-sakura-sushi"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Waka Sakura</a>
    
    <p>This conveyor belt sushi restaurant is located on the second floor of Tokyo Central in Gardena. The Wagyu trio is our favorite dish, but we haven't had anything disappointing here.</p>
    
    <a href="https://auntymailes808.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Aunty Maile's</a>
    
    <p>One of the best places in "Los Angeles" for (Hawaiian) local food. They serve big portions and also sometimes have other local snacks.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.thelocalplace.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">The Local Place</a>
    
    <p>Attached to the King's Hawaiian bakery, this place serves a fantastic local breakfast. Sheri and Andrew frequent this place when they end up at work too early and want to kill time before going to the office.</p>

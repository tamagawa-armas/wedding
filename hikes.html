    <h2>Our recommendations for:

     Hikes</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    <p>Some notes about hiking in Hawaii:
    <ul>
    <li>If it is raining, do not go hiking in the mountains. Water can form into surprise rivers/waterfalls very quickly, which are very dangerous to get caught in.</li>
    <li>Wild boars are dangerous animals. If you see one, don't make eye contact and slowly back away. If it looks like a pig, assume it's a boar.</li>
    <li>Wear mosquito repellent. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/sgtwD9CKKA8?si=IWrt6gxNRFxXplqE&t=25"; target="_blank">here</a> if you don't know why.</li>
    <li>Don't drink the mountain water, it is not clean and you can get <a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/leptospirosis/"; target="_blank">very sick</a>.</li>
    <li>Do NOT go on the Haiku stairs. Some people on the internet post about this, but it was deemed unsafe and it is illegal to trespass onto this trail. Please don't be a stupid tourist - it's disrespectful to the people who have perform rescues, and the people who have to pay for it.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>This is one of Sheri's favorite hikes. Moderately difficult and usually muddy, you can immerse yourself in the Hawaiian rainforest.</p>

    <p>This is another popular trail. There used to be the remains of a crashed WW2 plane on this trail, but it's unclear if it's still there. Watch out for dog poop.</p>

    <p>Did you want to tell people you went on a hike, but really prefer a casual stroll over pavement with beautiful ocean views? If so, this is the hike for you! This is a very easy, paved trail that overlooks the ocean. Some people go out here early in the morning to watch the sunrise. In the winter, this is a popular whale watching spot.</p>

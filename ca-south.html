    <h2>Our recommendations for:
    <br>
     Things to do south of LA</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.legoland.com/california/";target="_blank"; class="header-link">Legoland</a>  
    
    <p>Legoland is about an hour and 15 minutes away from “LA,” and will have heavy traffic during the morning and evening hours as people drive to and from work in southern Orange County and northern San Diego County. Legoland also has an attached Lego Aquarium that is a separate entrance fee and is also fun, with Lego sprinkled throughout the exhibits.</p>
    
    <a href="https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">San Diego Zoo</a>
    
    <p>The world famous San Diego Zoo is a very large zoo that can easily take the entire day to see every exhibit. Do take a ride on the bus tour to enjoy seeing several exhibits and animals that can be difficult to see from the ground. Also, the panda exhibit is open and you may need to wait to take pictures at the very end of the exhibit where you can stand above the rest of the crowd and potentially get a picture without the glass reflecting the crowd.</p>
    
    <a href="https://sdzsafaripark.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">San Diego Zoo Safari Park</a>
    
    <p>This is the San Diego Zoo’s other (and better!) location, it is mostly a large, open air safari for the animals to roam around. Take a ride in the trams to go around the large safari and see animals up close. There are other options that cost extra, like the zipline that goes over the safari and reaches up to 45 mph, other truck safaris that let you feed some of the animals, and other activities.</p>

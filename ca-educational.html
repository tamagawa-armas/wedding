    <p>This place has the California Science Center (see the Endeavor space shuttle!), the Natural History Museum (see taxidermy animals up close!), the California African American Museum, and a large rose garden. It will also soon host the Museum of Narrative Art, but it won't be finished by our wedding.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://www.bowers.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Bowers Museum</a>
    
    <p>Located in Santa Ana, Orange County, this is Orange County’s premier art museum. It concentrates on California, western Mexico and East Asian art. Be advised, it is closed on Mondays.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://www.aquariumofpacific.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Aquarium of the Pacific</a>
    
    <p>This large aquarium is a favorite Long Beach attraction for Sheri and Andrew. Be sure to check out their exhibits on California ocean ecosystems, watch their pinniped (seals and sea lions) show, and pet some sharks and rays! You can catch the pinniped show from the restaurant if you grab a seat by the window.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.queenmary.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Queen Mary</a>
    
    <p>While you're at the aquarium stop by the Queen Mary. RMS Queen Mary is a former Atlantic ocean liner that would go to serve as a troop transport during World War II before transitioning back as an ocean liner. She was retired in the 1960’s and moored in Long Beach, where you can tour the ship and relive the old days of ocean travel before the jet age replaced her. The Queen Mary is also alleged to be haunted and has tours to visit the rumored sightings on board.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://pacificbattleship.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Battleship Iowa</a>
    
    <p>The namesake of America’s largest battleship class, Iowa is located across the port of Long Beach from the Queen Mary and Aquarium of the Pacific. Step aboard and learn about naval history, World War II, and refitting for the Cold War.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://lazoo.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Los Angeles Zoo</a>
    
    <p>This large zoo is where Sheri and Andrew had their third date. Say hi to Puiwa the chimpanzee, who was born in Honolulu.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://griffithobservatory.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Griffith Observatory</a>
    
    <p>Griffith Observatory is located within Griffith Park and has a Foucault pendulum in the entrance to observe the effect of the Coriolis Effect. Learn about telescopes, the Sun and Moon, history of the Universe and the Solar System. Don’t forget to see the Tesla coil (the scientist Tesla, not the electric vehicle) or the bursts of visible light as positrons collide with electrons exhibits!</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://www.getty.edu/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">The Getty Center</a>
    
    <p>This is a very large, famous art museum. You could easily spend an entire day touring all of their exhibits. Entry is free but parking is not.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://www.getty.edu/visit/villa/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">The Getty Villa</a>
    
    <p>This place is temporarily closed due to the recent wildfires. However, when it's open it displays Mr. Getty's personal collection of ancient Roman art.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://wmof.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Western Museum of Flight</a>
    
    <p>Conveniently located in Torrance near our wedding venue, this museum contains two different plane exhibits. Be sure to ask early if you'd like to see the planes at the second location, because a certified volunteer needs to be available to take you there.</p>

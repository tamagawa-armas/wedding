    <h2>Our recommendations for:
    <br>
     Science and Nature</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    <p>You may also be interested in exploring the local <a href="botanical-gardens.html"; target="_blank">botanical gardens.</a></p>
    
    <a href="https://www.bishopmuseum.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Bishop Museum</a>
    
    <p>Learn about the local ecosystem and other cool science things in the science hall, and explore the Native Hawaiian garden. While you're here, be sure to check out the original building which was built in part by Andrew's ancestors.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.honoluluzoo.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Honolulu Zoo</a>
    
    <p>Learn about plants and animals from all over the world. If you're from the mainland, you might be especially interested in the nene - the descendents of Canadian geese that got lost in Hawaii a long time ago, and became much nicer than their mainland counterparts. Be sure to say hi to Rusty the orangutan! Note that the peacocks (and chickens) roaming around freely are not actually zoo animals - they're just wild birds that like to hang out.</p>
        
    <a href="https://www.waikikiaquarium.org/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Waikiki Aquarium</a>
    
    <p>While you're at the zoo, stop by the nearby aquarium. They have a very small parking lot, so we recommend planning to park elsewhere.</p>

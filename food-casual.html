     Casual Meals</h2>

    <a href="https://www.zippys.com/"; class="header-link">Zippy's Restaurant</a>
    
    <p>This is a well-known local diner, and always Sheri's first stop when she comes home. Sheri's favorite dish is the chili and chicken mixed plate, and Andrew's favorite is the saimin. They are also famous for their Zip Pac (President Obama's favorite!) and Korean chicken. For dessert, they are known for their Napples - apple is classic but chocolate is the best. </p>
    
                        
    <a href="https://www.lilihabakery.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Liliha Bakery</a> 
    
    <p>While this is primarily a bakery, the associated restaurant also serves tasty food. While Sheri and Andrew haven't actually eaten here for lunch or dinner, based on their breakfast food it's probably pretty good.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.alamoanacenter.com/en/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Ala Moana Shopping Center</a>
    
    <p>This is a large outdoor mall with many dining facilities (including a Liliha Bakery inside the Macy's!). For fast casual local flavors, check out The Lanai on the second floor. It's a food court, so you can walk around and see what looks/smells good before deciding.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.waiaholepoifactory.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Waiahole Poi Factory</a>
    
    <p>If you want to try Hawaiian food (traditional foods from the indigenous people of Hawaii), this is a great place to go. Laulau, kalua pork, and poi are all foods that have been enjoyed in Hawaii for thousands of years. Tip: if you find the taste of poi off-putting, try mixing the lomi salmon into it (and if it's still off-putting, try milk and sugar instead, but understand this is something children do). While not strictly traditional, the Sweet Lady of Waiahole dessert is always worth getting. </p>

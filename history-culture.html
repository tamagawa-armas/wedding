    <p>If you want to attend their luau dinner, be sure to reserve your space early!
        <br> Come learn about history and culture throughout the Pacific at this world-class interactive cultural museum. Attend live cultural presentations, sample food, make traditional crafts, and much more. If you want to fully experience all of the villages, plan to be here for more than one day. It is about an hour drive from our wedding venue (assuming no traffic), so plan accordingly. There are also available shuttles from Waikiki. You will spend a lot of time outdoors, so wear sunscreen and consider bringing a hat/sunglasses. If you only have one day to spend here, we recommend starting with the villages of Hawaii and Samoa.</p>

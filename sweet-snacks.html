    <h3 style="font-size: 24px">Baked treats</h3>
    
        <a href="https://www.zippys.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Zippy's Restaurant</a>
        <p>This restaurant's attached bakery is known for their Napples. Apple is classic but chocolate (when it's available) is better. A Napple is a light puff pastry with a filling.</p>
    
        <a href="https://www.lilihabakery.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Liliha Bakery</a> 
        <p>This bakery is famous for their coco puffs. The chantilly frosting topping is a top secret recipe, which Sheri has tried and failed to replicate.</p>
    
        <a href="https://leonardshawaii.com/home/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Leonard's Bakery</a>
        <p>Famous for their malasadas, their trucks can be found all over the island. A malasada is a fried dough all covered in sugar.</p>
    
        <a href="https://wholesaleunlimitedhi.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Wholesale Unlimited</a>
        <p>This store is a favorite for local snacks. If you're looking for something sweet, try their cookies, gummies, or dried fruit. </p>
    
        <a href="https://www.bigislandcandies.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Big Island Candies</a>
        <p>This place is famous for their diagonal dipped shortbread cookies. Their Chocolate Macadamia Nut Crunchies are equally amazing.</p>
    
        <header>McDonald's</header>
        <p>Do you miss when McDonald's deep fried their apple pies, giving them a perfectly light and crispy crust? They still do that in Hawaii! They ocasionally also have taro or haupia pies.</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 24px">Frozen treats</h3>
        
        <a href="https://www.waiaholepoifactory.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Waiahole Poi Factory</a>
        <p>If you want ice cream with a local twist, try the Sweet Lady of Waiahole dessert. </p>
        
        <a href="https://matsumotoshaveice.com/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Matsumoto's Shave Ice</a>
        <p>Some people (including Sheri) think this is the best shave ice on the island.
        <br>Here are some tips about eating shave ice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If it's called shave<b>d</b> ice instead of shave ice, go someplace else</li>
            <li>If you're not accustomed to the flavor of lihing, don't get your entire shave ice with that flavor. Instead, ask for strip of it with the rest of it another flavor (strawberry or banana would pair very well with it). Or, ask for lihing powder to be sprinkled on top if it's available.</li>
            <li>If you don't know what flavor to get, ask for rainbow because then you can sample multiple flavors. This is also the best option for Instagram-worthy pictures.</li>
            <li>Eating shave ice is a messy venture. Spread your legs apart (hopefully you aren't wearing a skirt), lean forward, and bite into it. Some of it will fall on the ground, and that's okay. Some places also offer plastic guards to catch the spillage.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <a href="https://www.waiolashaveice.co/"; target="_blank"; class="header-link">Waiola Shave Ice</a>
        <p>This is another contender for best shave ice on the island. It has a smoother consistency than Matsumoto's. See above for tips on eating shave ice.</p>

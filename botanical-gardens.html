    <h2>Our recommendations for:
    <br>
     Botanical Gardens</h2>
    
    <p>This page is under construction, but in the meantime enjoy the plain text.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/parks/hbg.html?id=569:ho"; class="header-link">Hoomaluhia Botanical Garden</a>
    
    <p>This is a large botanical garden, with a giant pond where you can feed the fish if you bring your own food. The further toward the back you go, the quieter and more peaceful it gets. Please be respectful of the locals and DO NOT show up early and block the road while people are trying to get to work. Do not play with the wild pigs, they are cute but they are dangerous animals.</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/cms-dpr-menu/site-dpr-sitearticles/568-foster-botanical-garden.html"; class="header-link">Foster Garden</a>
    
    <p>This is probably Oahu's most popular botanical garden.</p>
    
    
    <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/lyon/"; class="header-link">Lyon Arboretum</a>
    
    <p>This is an arboretum. Sheri has vague memories of going here for a school field trip once.</p>

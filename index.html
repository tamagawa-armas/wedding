            <h3> Parking for Hawaii Event</h3>
            <p> Park in the <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/NA3iQSXirmFy6vWL8'; target="_blank">main Hilton lot</a>. The address for the property is 2005 Kalia Road. From Kalia Road, turn onto Rainbow Drive and follow the signs for self parking, on the right. Once you've parked, follow signs to take the elevator to the Mid-Pacific Conference Center/South Pacific Ballrooms on the 6th floor. Then, take the escalators up, turn left, and look for the South Pacific Ballrooms on your right.</p> 
            
            <p>Please note that Kalia Road will be <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/03/19/kalia-road-repaving-sidewalk-repairs-underway-waikiki/">under construction</a>. Plan accordingly and Drive Aloha.</p>
            
            <p>We will host self-parking for our event. Valet parking is currently $20 per car. Overnight parking with the hotel rooms is significantly more.</p>

            <h3>Attire for Hawaii Event</h3>
            
                <p> The dress code for our wedding will be aloha formal/business casual. You can click <a href="hi-attire.html">here</a> for more details on what this means.</p>
            
                <p> The ceremony, pupu/cocktail hour, and reception will all be held in air conditioned spaces indoors. If you are prone to getting cold, we recommend bringing a light jacket.</p>
            
            
            <div class="divider-bar"></div>
            
            <h3> Travel Information for Hawaii Event</h3>
            
                <h4> Airport</h4>
                    <p>Use the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (HNL).</p>
            
                    <p>Be sure to bring a blue or black pen on your person when flying to Hawaii, as there is a form to fill out mid-flight. Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://airports.hawaii.gov/hnl/flights/agriculture-inspection/"; target="_blank">agricultural restrictions</a> when traveling between Hawaii and the mainland. These rules also apply if you are flying through the mainland but your final destination is elsewhere. These are super important! Hawaii has a unique ecosystem, and cross contamination either way could be devastating to both the environment and the economy.</p>
            
                <h4> Ground Transportation on Oahu</h4>
            
            <p>The trusted local taxi companies are <a href="https://thecabhawaii.com/#index"; target="_blank">The Cab</a> (<a href="tel:+18084222222">808-422-2222</a>) and <a href="https://charleystaxi.com/"; target="_blank">Charley's Taxi</a> (<a href="tel:+18082333333">808-233-3333</a>).</p>
            
            <p><a href="https://www.thebus.org/"; target="_blank">TheBus</a> is the local public transportation system, but we recommend a car if you want to go most places on the island.</p>
            
            <p>If you are planning to mostly stay in Waikiki, but leave once or twice to explore, consider looking into renting a car from <a href="https://www.drivehui.com/"; target="_blank">Hui</a>. Similar to Zipcar, you can do short term rentals from Waikiki. Note that the company uses dash cams to monitor driving safety.</p>            
            
            
                    <p>If you plan to stay on Oahu for more than just our wedding, we recommend renting a car from the airport.</p>

            
                    <p>Notes about rental cars:</p>
                        <ul><li>
                            If you're from the mainland, when you fill gas you might notice that the splash guard and locking lever are missing from the nozzles. This is normal - just manually keep the lever depressed and it will still automatically shut off when your tank is full.
                            </li>
                            <li>For those traveling with children, you can read up on child seat laws <a href="https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/safe-communites/child-passenger-safety/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            
            
                        </ul>
            
                    <p> Notes about pedestrian laws:</p>
                        <ul><li>
                            It is illegal to be distracted on your phone while crossing the street. When you get to an intersection, be alert of your surroundings and cross with your eyes on the road.
                            </li>
                            <li>You may not enter a crosswalk while the flashing red hand is on. If you don't enter the intersection before then, be patient and wait for the next light.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
            
                <h4> Hotel in Hawaii</h4>
                
                    <p> The wedding will be held at the <a href="https://hiltonhawaiianvillage.com"; target="_blank">Hilton Hawaiian Village</a> in Waikiki. You can use the coupon code WED to get a discount on rooms (Hawaii residents, contact Sheri for the Kama`aina code), but note that there may be better deals available, especially if you book early. This hotel will be ideal for guests who want a convenient location in relation to the wedding and want to stay in the heart of Waikiki with easy access to the beach and other tourist activities.   The wedding venue is connected to the Kalia Tower, but the entire complex is easily accessible from our ceremony and reception area.</p>
            
                    <p> For another option, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.alamoanahotelhonolulu.com/"; target="_blank">Ala Moana Hotel</a>. Located less than a mile from our wedding venue and attached to a large outdoor mall with many food options, this hotel is ideal for guests who want a cheaper but still convenient option. This location is walkable to our venue if you tolerate heat and humidity well (Hawaii is warm, even at night), and we recommend walking in groups at night. Note that the sponsored link on Google is not the official hotel website, and we recommend using the link above.</p>
            
                    <p>We recommend supporting the local economy and NOT going with an AirBnB-type rental which are primarily owned by people who live out of state.</p>
            
                    <p>Note: if you plan on preparing your own food while in Hawaii, be sure to thoroughly wash all locally grown produce that you plan to consume raw. <b>Thoroughly scrub</b> every surface under running water.</p>

        <h2> California Reception</h2>
            
            <p> Date: July 12, 2025</p>
            <p> Time: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm</p>
            <p> Location: <a href="https://www.jci-gardena.org/"; target="_blank">Gardena Valley Japanese Cultural Institute</a> in the Nisei Veterans Memorial Hall </p>
            
            <div class="divider-bar"></div>
            
            <h3>Parking for California Event</h3>
            
            <p>The address for the venue is 1964 W. 162nd Street, Gardena. There is a small parking lot attached to the venue. To access all of the stalls, turn into the lot from Gramercy Place. There is also ample street parking if the lot gets full. Note that there is Japanese school on Saturdays, so there will be other cars in the lot at the beginning of our event.</p>
            
            <p>The Nisei Veterans Memorial Hall is the one-story building on the property.</p>
            
            <div class="divider-bar"></div>
            
            <h3> Attire for California Event</h3>
                <p> The attire for this reception will be dressy casual. You can click <a href="ca-attire.html">here</a> for more information on what this means. The space will be air conditioned, so if you are prone to getting cold you should bring a light jacket.</p>
            
            <div class="divider-bar"></div>
            
            <h3>Travel Information for California Event</h3>
            
            <h4>Airport</h4>
            
                <p>If you prefer the cheapest possible direct flights, we recommend flying into LAX and renting a car.</p>
            
                <p>If you plan on spending more time in California, we recommend looking into using other nearby airports, such as Long Beach (LGB), John Wayne (SNA, closest to Disneyland), or Burbank (BUR). Flights will generally be more expensive than those coming from LAX, but the TSA lines will be shorter and there will be much less traffic getting to/from the airport.</p>
            
            <h4>Ground Transportation</h4>
            
                <p>The greater Los Angeles area is known for its lack of public transportation and heavy traffic. We recommend renting a car, but be prepared to sit in traffic and deal with aggressive drivers.</p>
            
            <h4>Hotel</h4>
            
            <p>We won't have a hotel block, and we haven't personally stayed in hotels in the area. However, the <a href="https://www.redachotel.com/"; target="_blank">Redac Gateway Hotel</a> and the <a href="https://www.miyakohybridhotel.com/"; target="_blank">Miyako Hybrid Hotel</a> are used by Sheri's company so they're probably okay.
            </p>

            <h3>Things To Do in "Los Angeles"</h3>
            
            <p>Why is "Los Angeles" in quotes? While people from other places might refer to the space between San Francisco and San Diego as Los Angeles, locals will insist that Los Angeles is geographically a small city. Almost nothing on this list is in Los Angeles proper.</p>

        <h2>Registry</h2>
            
            <p>The greatest gift at our wedding would be the presence of our friends and family. However, if giving gifts is important to you, we would most appreciate contributions toward a downpayment on a house.</p>
            
            <p>Since we've been living together for a while, and were living as independent adults before that, we have more than enough household items. If anyone needs a microwave, vacuum cleaner, or coffee table, we have extras available for pick up.</p>
            
            <p>We also have a small registry of items we don't have/need replacement <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/registry/12J5WF4Z0RAJB"; target="_blank">on Amazon</a>. Please note that the items are representative and we don't actually need the specific brands listed.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        
            <ul>
            <li><b>Am I invited?</b>
                <br>
                If you received a Save the Date, you should expect to receive a formal invitation in early March.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Will I get a plus one?</b>
                <br>Anyone not invited with their family or significant other will get a plus one, which will be indicated on your formal invitation. If you were invited and have a small child we didn't know about, please contact Andrew or Sheri before you RSVP.</li>
            <li><b>When are you sending out the invitations?</b>
                <br>
                We plan to send them out in early March, after we are able to finalize details for the second reception in California. We previously said February, but weren't able to finalize details for the California reception in time.
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a room block at the Hilton Hawaiian Village?</b>
                <br>
                No, but you can use the group code WED for a discount off the standard rate. Note that other available rates may be cheaper. Hawaii residents can contact Sheri for the Kamaaina discount code. </li>
            <li><b>When/where is the California reception?</b>
                <br>
                Please see <a href="#california">above</a>!
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a theme?</b>
                <br>
                The Hawaii reception has the theme "Purple Hawaii (but not tacky tourist) with a subtle hint of Star Wars."</li>
            <li><b>Which event should I attend, the one in Hawaii or in California?</b>
                <br>
                We encourage everyone to attend both events. If your situation makes that difficult, and both events are equally convenient for you, we recommend coordinating with your mutual friends and family to see where the other guests you know are gathering.</li>

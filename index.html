            <div class="divider-bar"></div>
            
            <h3> Travel Information for Hawaii Event</h3>
            
                <h4> Airport</h4>
                    <p>Use the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (HNL).</p>
            
                <h4> Groud Transportation on Oahu</h4>
                    <p>If you plan to stay on Oahu for more than just our wedding, we recommend renting a car from the airport.</p>
            
            <p>If you are planning to mostly stay in Waikiki, but leave once or twice to explore, consider looking into renting a car from <a href="https://www.drivehui.com/"; target="_blank">Hui</a>. Similar to Zipcar, you can do short term rentals from Waikiki. Note that the company uses dash cams to monitor driving safety.</p>
            
                    <p>Notes about rental cars:</p>
                        <ul><li>
                            If you're from the mainland, when you fill gas you might notice that the splash guard and locking lever are missing from the nozzles. This is normal - just manually keep the lever depressed and it will still automatically shut off when your tank is full.
                            </li>
                            <li>For those traveling with children, you can read up on child seat laws <a href="https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/safe-communites/child-passenger-safety/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            
            
                        </ul>
                        
            
                <h4> Hotel in Hawaii</h4>
                
                    <p> The wedding will be held at the <a href="https://hiltonhawaiianvillage.com"; target="_blank">Hilton Hawaiian Village</a> in Waikiki. You can use the coupon code WED to get a discount on rooms (Hawaii residents, contact Sheri for the Kama`aina code), but note that there may be better deals available, especially if you book early. This hotel will be ideal for guests who want a convenient location in relation to the wedding and want to stay in the heart of Waikiki with easy access to the beach and other tourist activities.   The wedding venue is connected to the Kalia Tower, but the entire complex is easily accessible from our ceremony and reception area.</p>
            
                    <p> For another option, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.alamoanahotelhonolulu.com/"; target="_blank">Ala Moana Hotel</a>. Located less than a mile from our wedding venue and attached to a large outdoor mall with many food options, this hotel is ideal for guests who want a cheaper but still convenient option. This location is walkable to our venue if you tolerate heat and humidity well (Hawaii is warm, even at night), and we recommend walking in groups at night.</p>
            
                    <p>We recommend supporting the local economy and NOT going with an AirBnB-type rental which are primarily owned by people who live out of state.</p>
            
                    <p>Note: if you plan on preparing your own food while in Hawaii, be sure to thoroughly wash all locally grown produce that you plan to consume raw. <b>Thoroughly scrub</b> every surface under running water.</p>

                    <li><a href="https://www.zippys.com/"; target="_blank">Zippy's Restaurant</a><br>This is a popular local diner. Sheri's favorite meal is the chili and chicken mixed plate, but other popular dishes include their Zip Min, Zip Pac (President Obama's favorite), and Korean fried chicken. For dessert, try their Napples!</li>
                        
                    <li><a href="https://www.lilihabakery.com/"; target="_blank">Liliha Bakery</a><br>They are famous for their coco puffs and local style breakfasts. Sheri also really enjoys their chantilly cakes - the frosting is unique and unmatched. </li>

                        The Kaneohe location has delicious local-style food with beautiful views of the Koolau mountain range. Note that they don't take reservations and have a small parking lot, so your best shot at a table is to show up before they open. The Haleiwa location is presumably also good, but we've never been out there.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.waiaholepoifactory.com/"; target="_blank">Waiahole Poi Factory</a>

                        <br>A contender for the best shave ice. If you don't know what flavor to get, try rainbow!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://matsumotoshaveice.com/"; target="_blank">Matsumoto's Shave Ice</a>
                        <br>Better shave ice than Waiola in some opinions. You can't go wrong with the rainbow flavor. Pro tips for eating shave ice: if it's called shave<b>d</b> ice find another place, and lean forward while you eat so you don't spill on yourself.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://foodland.com/";target="_blank">Foodland's Poke</a>

                    <li><a href="https://www.timessupermarkets.com/"; target="_blank">Times Supermarket's Poke</a>
                        <br>Sheri's family often gets their poke from Times instead of Foodland. The Hawaiian style and ahi shoyu are her favorites.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://wholesaleunlimitedhi.com/">Wholesale Unlimited</a>
                        <br>This is the go-to store for local snacks. If you don't know what you want, try everything!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.bigislandcandies.com/">Big Island Candies</a>

                    <li>McDonald's
                        <br>While you're in Hawaii, try their local breakfast platters (with spam and portuguese sausage) and their original deep fried apple pies. They occasionally also have taro pies and haupia pies.</li>

                        <br>
                        This is a large, beautiful botanical garden with a pond where you can feed the fish in a big pond. Further toward the back there are many quiet, easy hiking trails to explore. Please be respectful of the locals and DO NOT show up early and block the road as people are trying to get to work.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.kualoa.com/"; target="_blank">Kualoa Ranch</a>

                        <br>This is a beautiful, but somewhat challenging and often muddy hike. On all hikes, be sure to wear bug spray (mosquitoes), and DO NOT go hiking on the mountain if it is raining.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/aiea-loop-trail"; target="_blank">Aiea Loop Trail</a>
                        <br>Another beautiful hike, easier and generally less muddy than Maunawili. There used to be the remains of a crashed WWII plane, but it's unclear if it's still there. Watch your step for dog poop. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/makapu-u-point-lighthouse-trail"; target="_blank">Makapuu Lighthouse Trail</a>

                    <li>Waikiki Beach
                        <br>No visit to Oahu is complete without visiting this iconic beach. Just behind our wedding venue, there's not reason not to go for a stroll.</li>
                    <li>Kailua Beach
                        <br> This is another iconic beach, slightly less crowded than Waikiki.</li>
                    <li>Kualoa Regional Park
                        <br>If you're looking for a peaceful beach that hasn't been overrun by tourists (yet), check this place out. There's also a small native bird sanctuary. Great for barbecuing. Please be respectful of the locals trying to enjoy this space. Also beware of Portuguese-man-of-wars.</li>
                    <li>DO NOT GO: Haiku Stairs <br>DO NOT go on this trail. You may see some things on the internet about this, but it was deemed unsafe and it is illegal to go on this trail.

                <p> The attire for this reception will be dressy casual. You can click here [link not available yet] for more information on what this means. The space will be air conditioned, so if you are prone to getting cold you should bring a light jacket.</p>

            <h3>Travel Information</h3>
            
            <h4>Airport</h4>
            
                <p>If you prefer the cheapest possible direct flights, we recommend flying into LAX and renting a car.</p>
            
                <p>The closest airport to our venue is the John Wayne Orange County Airport (SNA). Flights will generally be more expensive than those coming from LAX, but the TSA lines will be shorter and there will be much less traffic getting to/from the airport.</p>
            
            <h4>Groud Transporation</h4>
            
                <p>The greater Los Angeles area is known for its lack of public transportation and heavy traffic. We recommend renting a car, but be prepared to sit in traffic and deal with aggressive drivers.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        
            <ul>
            <li><b>Am I invited?</b>
                <br>
                If you received a Save the Date, you should expect to receive a formal invitation in late January/early February. Anyone not invited with their family or significant other will get a plus one, which should be indicated on your formal invitation. If you were invited and have a child we didn't know about, please contact Andrew or Sheri before you RSVP.</li>
            <li><b>When are you sending out the invitations?</b>
                <br>
                We plan to send them out in late January or early February, after we are able to finalize details for the second reception.
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a room block at the Hilton Hawaiian Village?</b>
                <br>
                No, but you can use the group code WED for a discount. Hawaii residents can contact Sheri for the Kamaaina discount code. </li>
            <li><b>When/where is the California reception?</b>
                <br>
                We will let everyone know after we finalize details. Tentatively, it will be on a weekend in July at a community center in Huntington Beach but we have not been able to make the reservation yet. Details should be finalized by the end of January.
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a theme?</b>
                <br>
                The Hawaii reception has the theme "Purple Hawaii (but not tacky tourist) with a subtle hint of Star Wars."</li>

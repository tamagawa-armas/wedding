            <h3> Parking for Hawaii Event</h3>
            <p> Park in the <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/NA3iQSXirmFy6vWL8'; target="_blank">main Hilton lot</a>. The address for the property is 2005 Kalia Road. From Kalia Road, turn onto Rainbow Drive and follow the signs for self parking, on the right. There should be kiosks to pay for parking near our reception room. </p> 
            
            <p>As of 2024, self parking for events is $15. Overnight parking with the hotel rooms is significantly more.</p>
            
            <h3>Attire for Hawaii Event</h3>
            
                <p> The dress code for our wedding will be business casual/aloha. You can click here [link not available yet] for more details on what this means.</p>
            
                <p> The ceremony, pupu/cocktail hour, and reception will all be held in air conditioned spaces indoors. If you are prone to getting cold, we recommend bringing a light jacket.</p>
            
            
            
            <h3> Travel Information for Hawaii Event</h3>
            
                <h4> Airport</h4>
                    <p>Use the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)</p>
            
                <h4> Groud Transportation on Oahu</h4>
                    <p>If you plan to stay on Oahu for more than just our wedding, we recommend renting a car from the airport.</p>
            
            <p>If you are planning to mostly stay in Waikiki, but leave once or twice to explore, consider looking into renting a car from <a href="https://www.drivehui.com/"; target="_blank">Hui</a>. Similar to Zipcar, you can do short term rentals from Waikiki. Note that the company uses dash cams to moniter driving safety.</p>
            
                    <p>Note about rental cars: if you're from the mainland, when you fill gas you might notice that the splash guard and locking lever are missing from the nozzles. This is normal -just manually keep the lever depressed and it will still automatically shut off when your tank is full.</p>
            
                <h4> Hotel in Hawaii</h4>
                
                    <p> The wedding will be held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. You can use the coupon code WED to get a discount on rooms (Hawaii residents, contact Sheri for the Kama`aina code), but note that there may be better deals available, especially if you book early. This hotel will be ideal for guests who want a convenient location in relation to the wedding and want to stay in the heart of Waikiki with easy access to the beach and other tourist activities.   The wedding venue is connected to the Kalia Tower, but the entire complex is easily accessible from our ceremony and reception area.</p>
            
                    <p> For another option, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.alamoanahotelhonolulu.com/"; target="_blank">Ala Moana Hotel</a>. Located less than a mile from our wedding venue and attached to a large outdoor mall with many food options, this hotel is ideal for guests who want a cheaper but still convenient option. This location is walkable to our venue if you tolerate heat and humidity well (Hawaii is warm, even at night), and we recommend walking in groups at night.</p>
            
                    <p>We recommend supporting the local economy and NOT going with an AirBnB-type rental which are primarily owned by people who live out of state.</p>
            
                    <p>Note: if you plan on preparing your own food while in Hawaii, be sure to thoroughly wash all locally grown produce that you plan to consume raw. <b>Thoroughly scrub</b> every surface under running water.</p>

        <h2> California Reception</h2>
            
            <p> Date: TBD, July 2025</p>
            <p> Location: TBD, driving distance from Long Beach</p>
            
            <h3> Attire</h3>
                <p> The attire for this reception will be dressy casual. You can click here [link not available yet] for more information on what this means. The space will be air conditioned, so if you are prone to getting cold you should bring a light jacket.</p>
            
            <h3>Travel Information</h3>
            
            <h4>Airport</h4>
            
                <p>If you prefer the cheapest possible direct flights, we recommend flying into LAX and renting a car.</p>
            
                <p>The closest airport to our venue is the John Wayne Orange County Airport (SNA). Flights will generally be more expensive than those coming from LAX, but the TSA lines will be shorter and there will be much less traffic getting to/from the airport.</p>
            
            <h4>Groud Transporation</h4>
            
                <p>The greater Los Angeles area is known for its lack of public transportation and heavy traffic. We recommend renting a car, but be prepared to sit in traffic and deal with aggressive drivers.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><b>Am I invited?</b>
                <br>
                If you received a Save the Date, you should expect to receive a formal invitation in late January/early February. Anyone not invited with their family or significant other will get a plus one, which should be indicated on your formal invitation. If you were invited and have a child we didn't know about, please contact Andrew or Sheri before you RSVP.</li>
            <li><b>When are you sending out the invitations?</b>
                <br>
                We plan to send them out in late January or early February, after we are able to finalize details for the second reception.
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a room block at the Hilton Hawaiian Village?</b>
                <br>
                No, but you can use the group code WED for a discount. Hawaii residents can contact Sheri for the Kamaaina discount code. </li>
            <li><b>When/where is the California reception?</b>
                <br>
                We will let everyone know after we finalize details. Tentatively, it will be on a weekend in July at a community center in Huntington Beach but we have not been able to make the reservation yet. Details should be finalized by the end of January.
                </li>
            <li><b>Is there a theme?</b>
                <br>
                The Hawaii reception has the theme "Purple Hawaii (but not tacky tourist) with a subtle hint of Star Wars."</li>
